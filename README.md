I want to implement the Observer Pattern so that when the user adds events to the event planner
or makes changes to events the EventPlanner can be notified (Not implemented).
I want to implement the Decorator Pattern so that Meetings can have the attributes of location and
end time to delegate the additional properties to indivdual decorators, rather than the Meeting
class having all of that stuff inside of it.
